# instable3dexample

This repo reproduce the instability in the 3D inelastic Green's function.

`computeStressVerticalShearZone.m` is a copy of the [orginal matlab function](https://bitbucket.org/sbarbot/bssa-2016237/src/master/). Run `instability_example.m`
to show the instability when only viscoelastic relaxation is considered. `mesh.vtk` shows the example mesh used here.
